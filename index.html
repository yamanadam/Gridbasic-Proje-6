        <h1>AUTUMN İS COMİNG</h1>
        <p>
          Autumn is the slow decline of the year toward the winter, a slow
          lingering death from the height of summer into the cold and dark. Yet
          autumn is far from miserable. I love the unexpected warm days. I love
          the colours of the season and the wind and rain feels quite energetic
          and powerful. It has always felt like a season of portents and omens,
          birds are flocking, deer are rutting, autumnal colour is everywhere.
          <br />
          So how do we write what autumn feels like?
          <br />Autumn is nothing if not atmospheric. Countless horror movies
          are set at this time of year, no better demonstrated than it the cold
          and imposing forests of The Blair Witch Project and The Village. These
          are films that use Autumn atmosphere to maximum effect. It is the
          perfect time of year because death is a constant reminder. It is
          getting colder and darker; leaves are falling from the trees. There is
          a chill in the air overnight, frost on the ground in the morning, mist
          and fog in the air. Dry, dead leaves crunch beneath your feet and
          clouds appear when you breathe out. There is still a lingering warmth
          but always a constant reminder of the cold to come.
